      <p>
        In the period leading up to the final halving in July 2022, Dingocoin
        expects to list at 2-3 global top 30 marketplaces, based on existing
        dialogues, as well as several smaller marketplaces.

        SHORT-TERM LISTING AGENDA - DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGES
      </h4>

      <p>
        Dingocoin is proud to have a wrapped version available on BSC and SOL
        chains. We also plan to wrap Dingocoin to more DEXes, including an
        Ethererum wrap. As we already have the technology and the community
        backing to do this, we are certain of our efforts to list Dingocoin at
        many more DEXes.
      </p>

      <h4 className="mt-4">LONGER-TERM LISTING AGENDA</h4>

      <p>
        Past the final halving in July 2022, Dingocoin targets listings at both
        major and smaller marketplaces, and is working toward listing at a
        global top 5 marketplace when we are ready, as well as reaching 25+
        marketplaces in total by the end of 2022.
